# PersonLocator (setup)
This used Java code in combination with the Maven framework and Haversian formula system to find residents living within a certain range.

Install Eclipse and then install Maven and add the dependencies in the pom.xml of the compressed file I send.

Files with the data are in the compressed folders

Note: the paths in the FileReaders placed inside the BufferedReaders will be different for you so just change the string filepaths in the code.
